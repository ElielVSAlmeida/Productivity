# Welcome to Productivity Analysis!

First of all, this project aims to show a sample of the abilities in machine learning and neural networks (AI) using **SKLearn** and **TensorFlow**, for operation optimization it was used **OS** and **Dotenv**. The goal is to:
- Create a **Algorithmic Machine Learning Model** that is based on easily accessible business features.
- Build an in-depth **Data Analysis** with Interactable Graphs using **Tableau** to further the investigation of what drives Productivity.
- And format a **Data Base** where data can be stored, organized, related, secured and distributed using **SQL** and frameworks as **SQLAlchemy** and **MySLQConnector**.

 The data was cleaned and formatted with **Pandas**, also **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** was used for visualization.

# Analysis

The features describe poorly the target, meaning that yielding a high accuracy on the prediction would be almost impossible, and also leading easily to overfitted models.

# Obstacles

So I setted ranges for the model, transforming the target, therefore the model has only to predict the level (low, medium, high and very high) of the productivity, then with that prediction it will find the productivity percentages.

# Conclusion

Despite the obstacles, the model performed better than the benchmark, and it is pretty reliable to its intended use. See [Benchmark](https://github.com/dynasty-29/Productivity-Prediction-Project/blob/main/productivity_prediction_final.ipynb).
